A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into an electrical current.the current is generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode.photodiodes may contain optical filters, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas.photodiodes usually have a slower response time as their surface area increases.the common, traditional solar cell used to generate electric solar power is a large area photodiode.photodiodes are similar to regular semiconductor diodes except they may be either exposed ( to detect vacuum uv or x-rays ) or packaged with a window or optical fiber connection to allow light to reach the sensitive part of the device.many diodes designed for use specially as a photodiode use a pin junction rather than a p–n junction, to increase the speed of response.a photodiode is designed to operate in reverse bias.

rock flour, or glacial flour, consists of fine-grained, silt-sized particles of rock, generated by mechanical grinding of bedrock by glacial erosion or by artificial grinding to a similar size.because the material is very small, it becomes suspended in meltwater making the water appear cloudy, which is sometimes known as glacial milk.when the sediments enter a river, they turn the river's colour grey, light brown, iridescent blue-green, or milky white.if the river flows into a glacial lake, the lake may appear turquoise in colour as a result.when flows of the flour are extensive, a distinct layer of a different colour flows into the lake and begins to dissipate and settle as the flow extends from the increase in water flow from the glacier during snow melts and heavy rain periods.

algebra ( from  al-jabr '', meaning  reunion of broken parts '' and  bonesetting '' ) is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis.in its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols ; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics.it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields.elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics.abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians.elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.for example, in formula_1 the letter formula_2 is unknown, but applying additive inverses can reveal its value : formula_3.in, the letters formula_4 and formula_5 are variables, and the letter formula_6 is a constant, the speed of light in a vacuum.algebra gives methods for writing formulas and solving equations that are much clearer and easier than the older method of writing everything out in words.the word  algebra '' is also used in certain specialized ways.a special kind of mathematical object in abstract algebra is called an  algebra '', and the word is used, for example, in the phrases linear algebra and algebraic topology.a mathematician who does research in algebra is called an algebraist.

in geometry, the parallel postulate, also called euclid's fifth postulate because it is the fifth postulate in euclid's  elements '', is a distinctive axiom in euclidean geometry.it states that, in two-dimensional geometry, if a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.this postulate does not specifically talk about parallel lines ; it is only a postulate related to parallelism.euclid gave the definition of parallel lines in book i, definition 23 just before the five postulates.the postulate was long considered to be obvious or inevitable, but proofs were elusive.eventually it was discovered that inverting the postulate gave valid, albeit different geometries.geometry that is independent of euclid's fifth postulate ( i.e., only assumes the modern equivalent of the first four postulates ) is known as absolute geometry ( or sometimes  neutral geometry '' ).

in traditional logic, a contradiction consists of a logical incompatibility or incongruity between two or more propositions.it occurs when the propositions, taken together, yield two conclusions which form the logical, usually opposite inversions of each other.illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, aristotle's law of noncontradiction states that  it is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect.in modern formal logic, the term is mainly used instead for a  single '' proposition, often denoted by the falsum symbol formula_1 ; a proposition is a contradiction if false can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic.it is a proposition that is unconditionally false ( i.e., a self-contradictory proposition ).this can be generalized to a collection of propositions, which is then said to  contain '' a contradiction.

silence is the absence of ambient audible sound, the emission of sounds of such low intensity that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds ; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of communication, whether through speech or other medium.sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves.discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units, in turn-taking, or asreactive tokens, e.g., as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like.relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals ; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation.

A digital signal is a signal that is being used to represent data as a sequence of discrete values ; at any given time it can only take on, at most, one of a finite number of values.this contrasts with an analog signal, which represents continuous values ; at any given time it represents a real number within a continuous range of values.simple digital signals represent information in discrete bands of analog levels.all levels within a band of values represent the same information state.in most digital circuits, the signal can have two possible values ; this is called a binary signal or logic signal.they are represented by two voltage bands : one near a reference value ( typically termed as  ground '' or zero volts ), and the other a value near the supply voltage.these correspond to the two values  zero '' and  one '' ( or  false '' and  true '' ) of the boolean domain, so at any given time a binary signal represents one binary digit ( bit ).because of this discretization, relatively small changes to the analog signal levels do not leave the discrete envelope, and as a result are ignored by signal state sensing circuitry.as a result, digital signals have noise immunity ; electronic noise, provided it is not too great, will not affect digital circuits, whereas noise always degrades the operation of analog circuits.

wood fuel is a fuel such as firewood, charcoal, chips, sheets, pellets, and sawdust.the particular form used depends upon factors such as source, quantity, quality and application.in many areas, wood is the most easily available form of fuel, requiring no tools in the case of picking up dead wood, or few tools, although as in any industry, specialized tools, such as skidders and hydraulic wood splitters, have been developed to mechanize production.sawmill waste and construction industry by-products also include various forms of lumber tailings.the discovery of how to make fire for the purpose of burning wood is regarded as one of humanity's most important advances.the use of wood as a fuel source for heating is much older than civilization and is assumed to have been used by neanderthals.today, burning of wood is the largest use of energy derived from a solid fuel biomass.wood may be used indoors in a furnace, stove, or fireplace, or outdoors in furnace, campfire, or bonfire.

thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland, namely triiodothyronine ( t ) and thyroxine ( t ).they are tyrosine-based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism.a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t and t, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre.the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( t ), which has a longer half-life than t. in humans, the ratio of t to t released into the blood is approximately 14:1. t is converted to the active t ( three to four times more potent than t ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5′-iodinase ).these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( ta ) and thyronamine ( ta ).all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for t production.edward calvin kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915. in 2016 levothyroxine, a manufactured form of thyroxine, was the most prescribed medication in the united states with more than 114 million prescriptions.

very high frequency ( vhf ) omni-directional range ( vor ) is a type of short-range radio navigation system for aircraft, enabling aircraft with a receiving unit to determine its position and stay on course by receiving radio signals transmitted by a network of fixed ground radio beacons.it uses frequencies in the very high frequency ( vhf ) band from 108.00 to 117.95 mhz.developed in the united states beginning in 1937 and deployed by 1946, vor is the standard air navigational system in the world, used by both commercial and general aviation.in the year 2000 there were about 3,000 vor stations operating around the world including 1,033 in the us, reduced to 967 by 2013 ( stations are being decommissioned with widespread adoption of gps ).a vor ground station uses a phased antenna array to send a highly directional signal that rotates clockwise horizontally ( as seen from above ) 30 times a second.it also sends a 30 hz reference signal on a subcarrier timed to be in phase with the directional antenna as the latter passes magnetic north.this reference signal is the bearing from the vor station to the receiver relative to magnetic north.this line of position is called the vor  radial ''.the intersection of radials from two different vor stations can be used to fix the position of the aircraft, as in earlier radio direction finding ( rdf ) systems.vor stations are fairly short range : the signals are line of sight between transmitter and receiver and are useful for up to 200 miles.each station broadcasts a vhf radio composite signal including the navigation signal, station's identifier and voice, if so equipped.the navigation signal allows the airborne receiving equipment to determine a bearing from the station to the aircraft ( direction from the vor station in relation to magnetic north ).the station's identifier is typically a three-letter string in morse code.the voice signal, if used, is usually the station name, in-flight recorded advisories, or live flight service broadcasts

saint-calais is a commune in the sarthe department in the region of pays-de-la-loire in north-western france.prior to the french revolution it was known for its benedictine abbey named after the anisola stream ( modern aniole, a tributary of the braye ).saint-calais is a later name coming from one of the local saints of the perche area.william of st. calais, a product of this monastery, was a post-conquest bishop of durham.there are no remains of the abbey, which was a principal land-owner in the vicinity.reaction against monastic landowners and the relative proximity to paris ( under twenty-four hours by stage-coach ) conditioned the nineteenth century politics of the town.the coming of the railways and more recently the motorway favoured neighbouring la ferté-bernard which has grown at the expense of saint-calais, which has a population under 4000 and which lost its sous-préfecture status in 1926. the town however retains certain services appropriate to that level, e.g.hospital facilities.

The anus is an opening at the opposite end of an animal's digestive tract from the mouth.its function is to control the expulsion of feces, the residual semi-solid waste that remains after food digestion, which, depending on the type of animal, includes : matter which the animal can not digest, such as bones ; food material after the nutrients have been extracted, for example cellulose or lignin ; ingested matter which would be toxic if it remained in the digestive tract ; and dead or excess gut bacteria and other endosymbionts.amphibians, reptiles, and birds use the same orifice ( known as the cloaca ) for excreting liquid and solid wastes, for copulation and egg-laying.marsupials have a single orifice for excreting both solids and liquids and, in females, a separate vagina for reproduction.female placental mammals have completely separate orifices for defecation, urination, and reproduction ; males have one opening for defecation and another for both urination and reproduction, although the channels flowing to that orifice are almost completely separate.the development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of multicellular animals.it appears to have happened at least twice, following different paths in protostomes and deuterostomes.this accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments : the bilaterian body plan, the coelom, and metamerism, in which the body was built of repeated  modules '' which could later specialize, such as the heads of most arthropods, which are composed of fused, specialized segments

in mathematics, a divergent series is an infinite series that is not convergent, meaning that the infinite sequence of the partial sums of the series does not have a finite limit.if a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach zero.thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach zero diverges.however, convergence is a stronger condition : not all series whose terms approach zero converge.a counterexample is the harmonic seriesthe divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician nicole oresme.in specialized mathematical contexts, values can be objectively assigned to certain series whose sequences of partial sums diverge, in order to make meaning of the divergence of the series.a summability method or summation method is a partial function from the set of series to values.for example, cesàro summation assigns grandi's divergent series.the value.cesàro summation is an  averaging '' method, in that it relies on the arithmetic mean of the sequence of partial sums.other methods involve analytic continuations of related series.in physics, there are a wide variety of summability methods ; these are discussed in greater detail in the article on regularization.

a bier is a stand on which a corpse, coffin, or casket containing a corpse is placed to lie in state or to be carried to the grave.in christian burial, the bier is often placed in the centre of the nave with candles surrounding it, and remains in place during the funeral.in antiquity it was often a wooden board on which the dead were placed, covered with a shroud.in modern times, the corpse is rarely carried on the bier without being first placed in a coffin or casket, though the coffin or casket is sometimes kept open.a bier is often draped with cloth to lend dignity to the funeral service.the modern funeral industry uses a collapsible aluminium bier on wheels, known as a  church truck '' to move the coffin to and from the church or funeral home for services.biers are generally smaller than the coffin or casket they support for reasons of appearance, and can tip over unless well-centered and undisturbed.the carmelite priory at mdina, malta, has a colorful bier on display that was used to carry the monks or friars before they were buried without a coffin.ancient egyptians depicted biers used in their embalming practices and to bear royal coffins in the tomb.they were fashioned to resemble the goddess sekhmet, the fierce protector of the kings.

a bowl is a round dish or container typically used to prepare and serve food.the interior of a bowl is characteristically shaped like a spherical cap, with the edges and the bottom forming a seamless curve.this makes bowls especially suited for holding liquids and loose food, as the contents of the bowl are naturally concentrated in its center by the force of gravity.the exterior of a bowl is most often round but can be of any shape, including rectangular.the size of bowls varies from small bowls used to hold a single serving of food to large bowls, such as punch bowls or salad bowls, that are often used to hold or store more than one portion of food.there is some overlap between bowls, cups, and plates.very small bowls, such as the tea bowl, are often called cups, while plates with especially deep wells are often called bowls.in many cultures bowls are the most common kind of vessel used for serving and eating food.historically small bowls were also used for serving both tea and alcoholic drinks.in western culture plates and cups are more commonly used

lactose intolerance is a decreased ability to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products.those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop.symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea.these symptoms typically start thirty minutes to two hours after eating or drinking milk-based food.their severity typically depends on the amount a person eats or drinks.lactose intolerance is due to the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose.there are four types : primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital.primary lactose intolerance occurs as the amount of lactase declines as people age.secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine.such injury could be the result of infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases.developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time.congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth.diagnosis may be confirmed if symptoms resolve following eliminating lactose from the diet.other supporting tests include a hydrogen breath test and a stool acidity test.management is typically by decreasing the amount of lactose in the diet, taking lactase supplements, or treating the underlying disease.people are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk per sitting without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.the exact number of adults with lactose intolerance is unknown.it is common worldwide, affecting the majority of the world '

The standard model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces ( the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, and not including the gravitational force ) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles.it was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks.since then, confirmation of the top quark ( 1995 ), the tau neutrino ( 2000 ), and the higgs boson ( 2012 ) have added further credence to the standard model.although the standard model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions.it does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the universe as possibly described by dark energy.the model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology.it also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.the development of the standard model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike.for theorists, the standard model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of phenomena including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior.it is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries ( such as supersymmetry ) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the standard model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations

in statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on observed data : thus the rule ( the estimator ), the quantity of interest ( the estimand ) and its result ( the estimate ) are distinguished.there are point and interval estimators.the point estimators yield single-valued results, although this includes the possibility of single vector-valued results and results that can be expressed as a single function.in contrast to an interval estimator, where the result would be a range of plausible values ( or vectors or functions ).estimation theory is concerned with the properties of estimators ; that is, with defining properties that can be used to compare different estimators ( different rules for creating estimates ) for the same quantity, based on the same data.such properties can be used to determine the best rules to use under given circumstances.however, in robust statistics, statistical theory goes on to consider the balance between having good properties, if tightly defined assumptions hold, and having less good properties that hold under wider conditions.

the casimir effect and the casimir–polder force are physical forces arising from a quantized field.they are named after the dutch physicist hendrik casimir, who predicted them in 1948. they are named after the dutch physicist hendrik casimir, who predicted them in 1948. it was not until 1997 that a direct experiment by s. lamoreaux quantitatively measured the force to within 5 % of the value predicted by the theory.the casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the second-quantized electromagnetic field.since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.any medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the casimir effect.for example, beads on a string as well as plates submerged in turbulent water or gas illustrate the casimir force.in modern theoretical physics, the casimir effect plays an important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon ; in applied physics it is significant in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies

gnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family gnetaceae and order gnetales.they are tropical evergreen trees, shrubs and lianas.unlike other gymnosperms, they possess vessel elements in the xylem.some species have been proposed to have been the first plants to be insect-pollinated as their fossils occur in association with extinct pollinating scorpionflies.molecular phylogenies based on nuclear and plastid sequences from most of the southeast asian species indicate hybridization among some of the southeast asian species.fossil-calibrated molecular-clocks suggest that the  gnetum '' lineages now found in africa, south america and southeast asia are the result of ancient long-distance dispersal across seawater.their leaves are rich in bioactive compounds, like flavonoids and stilbenes, which have  remarkable medical effects ''.of the species studies so far, gnetum have photosynthetic and transpiration capacities which are considerably lower than those of other seed plants, due to the absence of multiple chloroplast genes essential for photosynthesis, a trait they seem to share with ephedra and welwitschia

leukodystrophies are a group of usually inherited disorders characterized by degeneration of the white matter in the brain.the word  leukodystrophy '' comes from the greek roots  leuko '',  white '',  dys '',  abnormal '' and  troph '',  growth ''.the leukodystrophies are caused by imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty insulating covering around nerve fibers.when damage occurs to white matter, immune responses can lead to inflammation in the central nervous system ( cns ), along with loss of myelin.the degeneration of white matter can be seen in an mri scan and used to diagnose leukodystrophy.the combined incidence of the leukodystrophies is estimated at 1 in 7,600.the majority of types involve the inheritance of an x-linked recessive, or x-linked dominant trait, while others, although involving a defective gene, are the result of spontaneous mutation rather than genetic inheritance.

ryan wayne white was an american teenager from kokomo, indiana, who became a national poster child for hiv/aids in the united states after failing to be re-admitted to school following a diagnosis of hiv from a contaminated factor viii blood treatment and, when diagnosed in december 1984, was given six months to live.as a hemophiliac, he became infected with hiv from a contaminated factor viii blood treatment and, when diagnosed in december 1984, was given six months to live.doctors said he posed no risk to other students, as aids is not an airborne disease and spreads solely through body fluids, but aids was poorly understood by the general public at the time.when white tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in howard county rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer.the u.s. congress passed a major piece of aids legislation, the ryan white care act, shortly after white's death, which was signed into law by president george h. w. bush in august 1990. the act has been reauthorized twice ; ryan white programs are the largest provider of services for people living with hiv/aids in the united states.

In physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy.it is the macroscopic energy associated with a system.the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant.if an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase ; and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object changes, the kinetic energy of the object also changes.in all real systems, however, nonconservative forces, such as frictional forces, will be present, but if they are of negligible magnitude, the mechanical energy changes little and its conservation is a useful approximation.in elastic collisions, the mechanical energy is conserved, but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy.the equivalence between lost mechanical energy ( dissipation ) and an increase in temperature was discovered by james prescott joule.many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy, e.g.an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a heat engine converts heat energy to mechanical energy.

The use of toxic chemicals as weapons dates back thousands of years, but the first large scale use of chemical weapons was during world war i.they were primarily used to demoralize, injure, and kill entrenched defenders, against whom the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective.the types of weapons employed ranged from disabling chemicals, such as tear gas, to lethal agents like phosgene, chlorine, and mustard gas.this chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century.the killing capacity of gas was limited, with about ninety thousand fatalities from a total of 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks.gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures, such as gas masks.in the later stages of the war, as the use of gas increased, its overall effectiveness diminished.the widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare, and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives, gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of world war i as  the chemist's war '' and also the era where weapons of mass destruction were created.the use of poison gas by all major belligerents throughout world war i constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the 1907 hague convention on land warfare, which prohibited the use of  poison or poisoned weapons '' in warfare.widespread horror and public revulsion at the use of gas and its consequences led to far less use of chemical weapons by combatants during world war ii.

sewage is a type of wastewater that is produced by a community of people.it is characterized by volume or rate of flow, physical condition, chemical and toxic constituents, and its bacteriologic status ( which organisms it contains and in what quantities ).it consists mostly of greywater ( from sinks, bathtubs, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers ), blackwater ( the water used to flush toilets, combined with the human waste that it flushes away ) ; soaps and detergents ; and toilet paper ( less so in regions where bidets are widely used instead of paper ).sewage usually travels from a building's plumbing either into a sewer, which will carry it elsewhere, or into an onsite sewage facility ( of which there are many kinds ).whether it is combined with surface runoff in the sewer depends on the sewer design ( sanitary sewer or combined sewer ).the reality is that most wastewater produced globally remains untreated, causing widespread water pollution, especially in low-income countries : a global estimate by undp and un-habitat is that 90 % of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated.in many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only.

In optics, an image is defined as the collection of focus points of light rays coming from an object.a real image is the collection of focus points actually made by converging rays, while a virtual image is the collection of focus points made by extensions of diverging rays.in other words, a virtual image is found by tracing real rays that emerge from an optical device ( lens, mirror, or some combination ) backward to perceived or apparent origins of ray divergences.in diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by dotted lines.because the rays never really converge, a virtual image can not be projected onto a screen.in contrast, a real image can be projected onto a diffusely reflecting screen so people can see the image ( the image on the screen plays as an object to be imaged by human eyes )

binoculars are two telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point in the same direction, allowing the viewer to use both eyes ( binocular vision ) when viewing distant objects.most are sized to be held using both hands, although sizes vary from opera glasses to large pedestal mounted military models.unlike a ( monocular ) telescope, binoculars give users a three-dimensional ( 3d ) image : for nearer objects the two views, presented to each of the viewer's eyes from slightly different viewpoints, produce a merged view with an impression of depth.

a resistance movement is an organized effort by some portion of the civil population of a country to withstand the legally established government or an occupying power and to disrupt civil order and stability.it may seek to achieve its objectives through either the use of nonviolent resistance ( sometimes called civil resistance ), or the use of force, whether armed or unarmed.in many cases, as for example in norway in the second world war, a resistance movement may employ both violent and non-violent methods, usually operating under different organizations and acting in different phases or geographical areas within a country.on the lawfulness of armed resistance movements in international law, there has been a dispute between states since at least 1899, when the first major codification of the laws of war in the form of a series of international treaties was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the great powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.more recently the 1977 protocol additional to the geneva conventions of 12 august 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, referred in article 1. paragraph 4 to armed conflicts ... in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes... '' this phraseology contains many ambiguities that cloud the issue of who is or is not a legitimate combatant.hence depending on the perspective of a state's government, a resistance movement may or may not be labelled a terrorist group based on whether the members of a resistance movement are considered lawful or unlawful combatants and whether they are recognized as having a right to resist occupation.ultimately, the distinction is a political judgment

Ammonium chlorate is an inorganic compound with the formula nhclo.it is obtained by neutralizing chloric acid with either ammonia or ammonium carbonate, or by precipitating barium, strontium or calcium chlorates with ammonium carbonate or ammonium sulfate, producing the respective carbonate or sulfate precipitate and an ammonium chlorate solution.ammonium chlorate crystallizes in small needles, readily soluble in water.the bitartrate method is a candidate for production and can be used if exotic chlorates are currently inaccessible or need to be synthesized.warm solutions of potassium chlorate and ammonium bitartrate are needed in warm solutions.the latter can be synthesized by adding aqueous ammonia to an excess of tartaric acid, then, a double displacement reaction will result in precipitation of potassium bitartrate.on heating, ammonium chlorate decomposes at about 102 °c, with liberation of nitrogen, chlorine and oxygen.it is soluble in dilute aqueous alcohol, but insoluble in strong alcohol.this compound is a powerful oxidizer and should never be stored with flammable materials, as it can easily form sensitive explosive compositions.ammonium chlorate is a very unstable oxidizer and will decompose independently, sometimes violently, at room temperature.this results from the mixture of the reducing ammonium cation and the oxidizing chlorate anion.even solutions are known to be unstable.because of the dangerous nature of this salt it should only be kept in solution when needed, and never be allowed to crystallize.

cruelty to animals is the infliction by omission ( neglect ) or by commission by humans of suffering or harm upon any non-human.more narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement, such as killing animals for entertainment ; cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, defined as zoosadism.divergent approaches to laws concerning animal cruelty occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world.for example, some laws govern methods of killing animals for food, clothing, or other products, and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment, education, research, or pets.there are a number of conceptual approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals.some think that the animal welfare position holds that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for human purposes, such as food, clothing, entertainment, fun and research, but that it should be done in a way that minimizes unnecessary pain and suffering, sometimes referred to as  humane '' treatment.utilitarian advocates argue from the position of costs and benefits and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals.some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach which is closer to the animal welfare position, whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights.animal rights theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words  unnecessary '' and  humane '' are subject to widely differing interpretations, and that animals have basic rights.

In baseball, a single is the most common type of base hit, accomplished through the act of a batter safely reaching first base by hitting a fair ball ( thus becoming a runner ) and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out.as an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play ; this is one type of a fielder's choice.also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out ( as a fielder's choice ) is not credited with a single.on a single hit to the outfield, any runners on second base or third base normally score, and sometimes the runner from first base is able to advance to third base.depending on the location of the hit, a quick recovery by the outfielder can prevent such an advance or create a play on the advancing runner.ty cobb, pete rose, tony gwynn, and ichiro suzuki are examples of contact hitters ; of these, rose and suzuki might be called slap hitters.

random-access memory ( ram ) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.a random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.in contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, cd-rws, dvd-rws and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.ram contains multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry.usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and ram devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be  8-bit '' or  16-bit '' devices.in today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuit ( ic ) chips with mos ( metal-oxide-semiconductor ) memory cells.ram is normally associated with volatile types of memory ( such as dynamic random-access memory ( dram ) modules ), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile ram has also been developed.other types of non-volatile memories exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them.these include most types of rom and a type of flash memory called  nor-flash ''.commercial uses of semiconductor ram date back to 1965, when ibm introduced the sp95 sram chip for their system/360 model 95 computer, and toshiba used dram memory cells for its toscal bc-1411 electronic calculator, both based on bipolar transistors

In cryptography, key size or key length is the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm ( such as a cipher ).key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security ( i.e.a logarithmic measure of the fastest known attack against an algorithm ), since the security of all algorithms can be violated by brute-force attacks.indeed, most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have security equal to their key length, however, after design, a new attack might be discovered ( i.e.triple des was designed to have a 168 bit key, but an attack of complexity 2 is now known ( i.e.triple des now only has 112 bits of security, and of the 168 bits in the key the attack has rendered 56 'ineffective' towards security ).nevertheless, as long as the security ( understood as 'the amount of effort it would take to gain access') is sufficient for a particular application, then it doesn't matter if key length and security coincide.

dunstanburgh castle is a fortification on the coast of northumberland in northern england, between the villages of craster and embleton.the castle was built by earl thomas of lancaster between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site's natural defences and the existing earthworks of an iron age fort.thomas was a leader of a baronial faction opposed to king edward ii, and probably intended dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern england deteriorate.the castle also served as a statement of the earl's wealth and influence, and would have invited comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of bamburgh.thomas probably only visited his new castle once, before being captured at the battle of boroughbridge as he attempted to flee royal forces for the safety of dunstanburgh.thomas was executed, and the castle became the property of the crown before passing into the duchy of lancaster.dunstanburgh's defences were expanded in the 1380s by john of gaunt, the duke of lancaster, in the light of the threat from scotland and the peasant uprisings of 1381. the fortress never recovered from the sieges of these campaigns, and by the 16th century the warden of the scottish marches described it as having fallen into  wonderfull great decaye ''

in telecommunications, dirty paper coding ( dpc ) or costa precoding is a technique for efficient transmission of digital data through a channel subjected to some interference known to the transmitter.the technique consists of precoding the data in order to cancel the interference.dirty-paper coding achieves the channel capacity, without a power penalty and without requiring the receiver to know the interfering signal.the term  dirty paper coding '' was coined by max costa who compared the technique to writing a message on a piece of paper which is partially soiled with random ink strokes or spots.by erasing and adding ink in the proper places, the writer can convey just as much information as if the paper was clean, even though the reader does not know where the dirt was.in this analogy, the paper is the channel, the dirt is interference, the writer is the transmitter, and the reader is the receiver.note that dpc at the encoder is an information-theoretic dual of wyner-ziv coding at the decoder.

In a computer operating system that uses paging for virtual memory management, page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to page out, sometimes called swap out, or write to disk, when a page of memory needs to be allocated.page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory ( page fault ) and a free page can not be used to satisfy the allocation, either because there are none, or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.when the page that was selected for replacement and paged out is referenced again it has to be paged in ( read in from disk ), and this involves waiting for i/o completion.this determines the  quality '' of the page replacement algorithm : the less time waiting for page-ins, the better the algorithm

stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the deformation of the material.for example, when a solid vertical bar supporting an overhead weight, each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it.when a liquid is in a closed container under pressure, each particle gets pushed against by all the surrounding particles.the container walls and the pressure-inducing surface ( such as a piston ) push against them in ( newtonian ) reaction.these macroscopic forces are actually the net result of a very large number of intermolecular forces and collisions between the particles in those molecules

enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts ( biocatalysts ).catalysts accelerate chemical reactions.the molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products.almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps.the study of enzymes is called  enzymology '' and a new field of pseudoenzyme analysis has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic'properties.enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types.other biocatalysts are catalytic rna molecules, called ribozymes.enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules : inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity.many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors.an enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and ph, and many enzymes are ( permanently ) denatured when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties

atari jaguar is a home video game console that was developed by atari corporation and originally released in north america in november 1993.a successor to the 7800, the jaguar came as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles and was, controversially, marketed by atari as being the world's first  64-bit '' video game system, while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles ( sega genesis and super nintendo entertainment system ) and the 32-bit 3do interactive multiplayer platform ( which launched the same year ).the jaguar shipped with  cybermorph '' as the pack-in game.development on the atari jaguar started in the early 1990s by flare technology.the multi-chip architecture, hardware bugs, and lacking developer support tools made game development difficult.this, in addition to the lack of internal development at atari, led to a games library comprising only 50 licensed titles, plus another 13 games on the jaguar cd.atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the atari jaguar cd add-on and marketing the jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $ 100 less than any of its competitors.however, with the release of the sega saturn and sony playstation in 1995, sales of the jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996.since its discontinuation, the jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces homebrew games for the console.

A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures.at least one of results of the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents.in some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture into pure constituents.separations exploit differences in chemical properties or physical properties ( such as size, shape, mass, density, or chemical affinity ) between the constituents of a mixture.processes are often classified according to the particular differences they use to achieve separation.if no single difference can be used to accomplish the desired separation, multiple operations can often be combined to achieve the desired end.with a few exceptions, elements or compounds exist in nature in an impure state.often these raw materials must go through a separation before they can be put into productive use, making separation techniques essential for the modern industrial economy.the purpose of separation may be  analytical '', can be used as a lie component in the original mixture without any attempt to save the fractions, or maybe  preparative '', i.e.to  prepare '' fractions or samples of the components that can be saved.the separation can be done on a small scale, effectively a laboratory scale for analytical or preparative purposes, or on a large scale, effectively an industrial scale for preparative purposes, or on some intermediate scale.

stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.stoichiometry is founded on the law of conservation of mass where the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products.this means that if the amounts of the separate reactants are known, then the amount of the product can be calculated.conversely, if one reactant has a known quantity and the quantity of the products can be empirically determined, then the amount of the other reactants can also be calculated.this is illustrated in the image here, where the balanced equation is : here, one molecule of methane reacts with two molecules of oxygen gas to yield one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water.this particular chemical equation is an example of complete combustion.stoichiometry measures these quantitative relationships, and is used to determine the amount of products and reactants that are produced or needed in a given reaction.describing the quantitative relationships among substances as they participate in chemical reactions is known as  reaction stoichiometry ''.because of the well known relationship of moles to atomic weights, the ratios that are arrived at by stoichiometry can be used to determine quantities by weight in a reaction described by a balanced equation.this is called  composition stoichiometry ''.gas stoichiometry '' deals with reactions involving gases, where the gases are at a known temperature, pressure, and volume and can be assumed to be ideal gases.in practice, due to the existence of isotopes, molar masses are used instead when calculating the mass ratio.

bamburgh castle is a castle on the northeast coast of england, by the village of bamburgh in northumberland.it is a grade i listed building.the site was originally the location of a celtic brittonic fort known as  din guarie '' and may have been the capital of the kingdom of bernicia from its foundation in 420 to 547.after passing between the britons and the anglo-saxons three times, the fort came under anglo-saxon control in 590.the fort was destroyed by vikings in 993, and the normans later built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one.after a revolt in 1095 supported by the castle's owner, it became the property of the english monarch.in the 17th century, financial difficulties led to the castle deteriorating, but it was restored by various owners during the 18th and 19th centuries.it was finally bought by the victorian era industrialist william armstrong, who completed its restoration.the castle still belongs to the armstrong family and is open to the public.
a volcanic belt is a large volcanically active region.other terms are used for smaller areas of activity, such as volcanic fields.volcanic belts are found above zones of unusually high temperature ( 700-1400 °c ) where magma is created by partial melting of solid material in the earth's crust and upper mantle.these areas usually form along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10–50 km.for example, volcanoes in mexico and western north america are mostly in volcanic belts, such as the trans-mexican volcanic belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern mexico and the northern cordilleran volcanic province in western canada.the deeply deformed and eroded remnants of ancient volcanic belts are found in volcanically inactive regions such as the canadian shield.it contains over 150 volcanic belts ( now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat plains ) that range from 600 to 1200 million years old.these are zones of variably metamorphosed mafic to ultramafic volcanic sequences with associated sedimentary rocks that form what are known as greenstone belts.volcanic belts are similar to a mountain range, but the mountains within the mountain range are volcanoes, not mountains that are formed by faulting and folding by the collision of tectonic plates.

Oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen, is the use of oxygen as a medical treatment.this can include for low blood oxygen, carbon monoxide toxicity, cluster headaches, and to maintain enough oxygen while inhaled anesthetics are given.long-term oxygen is often useful in people with chronically low oxygen such as from severe copd or cystic fibrosis.oxygen can be given in a number of ways including nasal cannula, face mask, and inside a hyperbaric chamber.oxygen is required for normal cell metabolism.excessively high concentrations can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure in those who are predisposed.higher oxygen concentrations also increase the risk of fires, particularly while smoking, and without humidification can also dry up the nose.the target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated.in most conditions a saturation of 94–96 % is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88–92 % are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest they should be as high as possible.air is typically 21 % oxygen by volume while oxygen therapy increases this by some amount up to 100 %.the use of oxygen in medicine became common around 1917. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines.the cost of home oxygen is about us $ 150 a month in brazil and us $ 400 a month in the united states.home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or an oxygen concentrator.oxygen is believed to be the most common treatment given in hospitals in the developed world.

semeval is an ongoing series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems ; it evolved from the senseval word sense evaluation series.the evaluations are intended to explore the nature of meaning in language.while meaning is intuitive to humans, transferring those intuitions to computational analysis has proved elusive.this series of evaluations is providing a mechanism to characterize in more precise terms exactly what is necessary to compute in meaning.as such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning.these exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language.they began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally.they have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence ( e.g., semantic role labeling ), relations between sentences ( e.g., coreference ), and the nature of what we are saying ( semantic relations and sentiment analysis ).

drought in the united states is similar to that of other portions of the globe.below normal precipitation leads to drought, which is caused by an above average persistence of high pressure over the drought area.changes in the track of extratropical cyclones, which can occur during climate cycles such as the el nio-southern oscillation, or enso, as well as the north atlantic oscillation, pacific decadal oscillation, and atlantic multidecadal oscillation, modulates which areas would be more prone to drought and when drought develops.in dry areas, removing grass cover and going with a more natural vegetation for the area can reduce the impact of drought, since a significant amount of fresh water is used to keep lawns green.the worst droughts in the history of the united states occurred during the 1930s and 1950s, periods of time known as 'dust bowl'years in which droughts lead to significant economic damages and social changes.in particular, relief and health agencies became overburdened and many local community banks had to close.

In statistics, the method of moments is a method of estimation of population parameters.it starts by expressing the population moments ( i.e.the expected values of powers of the random variable under consideration ) as functions of the parameters of interest.those expressions are then set equal to the sample moments.the number of such equations is the same as the number of parameters to be estimated.those equations are then solved for the parameters of interest.the solutions are estimates of those parameters.the method of moments was introduced by pafnuty chebyshev in 1887 in the proof of the central limit theorem.the idea of matching empirical moments of a distribution to the population moments dates back at least to pearson.

a parallel port is a type of interface found on computers for connecting peripherals.the name refers to the way the data is sent ; parallel ports send multiple bits of data at once ( parallel communication ), as opposed to serial communication, in which bits are sent one at a time.to do this, parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and port connectors and tend to be larger than contemporary serial ports, which only require one data line.there are many types of parallel ports, but the term has become most commonly associated with the printer port or centronics port found on most personal computers from the 1970s through the 2000s.it was an industry  de facto '' standard for a long time, and was finally standardized as ieee 1284 in the late 1990s, which defined the enhanced parallel port ( eep ) and extended capability port ( ecp ) bi-directional versions.today, the parallel port interface is virtually non-existent because of the rise of universal serial bus ( usb ) devices, along with network printing using ethernet and wi-fi connected printers.the parallel port interface was originally known as the parallel printer adapter on ibm pc-compatible computers.it was primarily designed to operate printers that used ibm's eight-bit extended ascii character set to print text, but could also be used to adapt other peripherals.graphical printers, along with a host of other devices, have been designed to communicate with the system

a stay-at-home order, safer-at-home order, or a movement control order ( more common in southeast asia ), also known by loosely using the terms ( self- ) quarantine, ( self- ) isolation, or lockdown is an order from a government authority to restrict movements of a population as a mass quarantine strategy for suppressing, or mitigating, an epidemic, or pandemic, by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses.the medical distinction between such an order and quarantine is that quarantine is usually understood to involve isolating only selected people who are considered to be possibly infectious, rather than the entire population of an area ( though many colloquially refer to stay-at-home orders as quarantine ) in many cases, outdoor activities are allowed.in many cases, non-essential businesses are either closed or adapted to working from home.in some regions, it has been implemented as a round-the-clock curfew or called a shelter-in-place order, but it is not to be confused with a shelter-in-place situation.similar measures have been used around the world, and, both officially and colloquially, different names have been used to refer to them, often only very loosely linked to the term’s actual medical meaning.

a prefix is an affix which is placed before the stem of a word.adding it to the beginning of one word changes it into another word.for example, when the prefix  un- '' is added to the word  happy '', it creates the word  unhappy ''.particularly in the study of languages, a prefix is also called a preformative, because it alters the form of the words to which it is affixed.prefixes, like other affixes, can be either inflectional, creating a new form of the word with the same basic meaning and same lexical category ( but playing a different role in the sentence ), or derivational, creating a new word with a new semantic meaning and sometimes also a different lexical category.in english, there are no inflectional prefixes ; english uses suffixes instead for that purpose.the word  prefix '' is itself made up of the stem  fix '' ( meaning  attach '' ) and the prefix  pre- '' ( meaning  before '' ), both of which are derived from latin roots.

a cytotoxic t cell is a type of white blood cell that kills cancer cells, cells that are infected ( particularly with viruses ) or cells that are damaged in other ways.most cytotoxic t cells express t-cell receptors ( tcrs ) that can recognize a specific antigen.an antigen is a molecule capable of stimulating an immune response and is often produced by cancer cells or viruses.antigens inside a cell are bound to class i mhc molecules, and brought to the surface of the cell by the class i mhc molecule, where they can be recognized by the t cell.if the tcr is specific for that antigen, it binds to the complex of the class i mhc molecule and the antigen, and the t cell destroys the cell.in order for the tcr to bind to the class i mhc molecule, the former must be accompanied by a glycoprotein called cd8, which binds to the constant portion of the class i mhc molecule.the affinity between cd8 and the mhc molecule keeps the t cell and the target cell bound closely during antigen-specific activation.

in physics, the wavelength is the spatial period of a periodic wave—the distance over which the wave's shape repeats.it is the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase on the wave, such as two adjacent crests, troughs, or zero crossings, and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves, as well as other spatial wave patterns.the inverse of the wavelength is called the spatial frequency.the term  wavelength '' is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids.assuming a sinusoidal wave moving at a fixed wave speed, wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency of the wave : waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.wavelength depends on the medium ( for example, vacuum, air, or water ) that a wave travels through.examples of waves are sound waves, light, water waves and periodic electrical signals in a conductor.a sound wave is a variation in air pressure, while in light and other electromagnetic radiation the strength of the electric and the magnetic field vary.water waves are variations in the height of a body of water.in a crystal lattice vibration, atomic positions vary.the range of wavelengths or frequencies for wave phenomena is called a spectrum.the name originated with the visible light spectrum but now can be applied to the entire electromagnetic spectrum as well as to a sound spectrum or vibration spectrum.

potassium–argon dating is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology and archaeology.it is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium ( k ) into argon ( ar ).potassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay minerals, tephra, and evaporites.in these materials, the decay product is able to escape the liquid ( molten ) rock, but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies ( recrystallizes ).the amount of argon sublimation that occurs is a function of the purity of the sample, the composition of the mother material, and a number of other factors.these factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating, so that final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation, melting, and exposure to decreased pressure and/or open-air.time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of argon accumulated to the amount of remaining.the long half-life of potassium allows the method to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.the quickly cooled lavas that make nearly ideal samples for k–ar dating also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field as the sample cooled past the curie temperature of iron.the geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using k–ar dating.

a genetic disorder is a health problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome.it can be caused by a mutation in a single gene ( monogenic ) or multiple genes ( polygenic ) or by a chromosomal abnormality.although polygenic disorders are the most common, the term is mostly used when discussing disorders with a single genetic cause, either in a gene or chromosome.the mutation responsible can occur spontaneously before embryonic development ( a  de novo '' mutation ) or it can be inherited from two parents who are carriers of a faulty gene ( autosomal recessive inheritance ) or from a parent with the disorder ( autosomal dominant inheritance ).some disorders are caused by a mutation on the x chromosome and have x-linked inheritance.very few disorders are inherited on the y chromosome or mitochondrial dna.there are well over 6,000 known genetic disorders, and new genetic disorders are constantly being described in medical literature.around 1 in 50 people are affected by a known single-gene disorder, while around 1 in 263 are affected by a chromosomal disorder.around 65 % of people have some kind of health problem as a result of congenital genetic mutations.due to the significantly large number of genetic disorders, approximately 1 in 21 people are affected by a genetic disorder classified as  rare '' ( usually defined as affecting less than 1 in 2,000 people ).most genetic disorders are rare in themselves, though predispositions and cancer syndromes exist.

pethidine, also known as meperidine and sold under the brand name demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class.synthesized in 1938 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the german chemist otto eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by otto schaumann while working for ig farben, germany.pethidine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, and is delivered as a hydrochloride salt in tablets, as a syrup, or by intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection.for much of the 20th century, pethidine was the opioid of choice for many physicians ; in 1975, 60 % of doctors prescribed it for acute pain and 22 % for chronic severe pain.it was patented in 1937 and approved for medical use in 1943. compared with morphine, pethidine was thought to be safer, carry a lower risk of addiction, and to be superior in treating the pain associated with biliary spasm or renal colic due to its putative anticholinergic effects.these were later discovered to be all myths, as it carries an equal risk of addiction, possesses no advantageous effects on biliary spasm or renal colic compared to other opioids, and due to its toxic metabolite, norpethidine, it is more toxic than other opioids—especially during long-term use.the norpethidine metabolite was found to have serotonergic effects, so pethidine could, unlike most opioids, contribute to serotonin syndrome.

a dissenting opinion is an opinion in a legal case written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court which gives rise to its judgment.when not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a minority report.dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions, and are also delivered and published at the same time.a dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law, though they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's holding should be limited or overturned.in some legal systems, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law, and a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular understanding of the law formerly advocated in dissent.as with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often illuminate the precise holding of the majority opinion.

deregulation is the process of removing or reducing state regulations, typically in the economic sphere.it is the repeal of governmental regulation of the economy.it became common in advanced industrial economies in the 1970s and 1980s, as a result of new trends in economic thinking about the inefficiencies of government regulation, and the risk that regulatory agencies would be controlled by the regulated industry to its benefit, and thereby hurt consumers and the wider economy.economic regulations were promoted during the gilded age, in which progressive reforms were touted as necessary to limit externalities like corporate abuse, unsafe child labor, monopolization, pollution, and to mitigate boom and bust cycles.around the late 1970s, such reforms were deemed as burdensome on economic growth and many politicians espousing neoliberalism started promoting deregulation.the stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to raised levels of competitiveness, therefore higher productivity, more efficiency and lower prices overall.opposition to deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding environmental pollution and environmental quality standards ( such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials ), financial uncertainty, and constraining monopolies.regulatory reform is a parallel development alongside deregulation.

volcanic plug, also called a volcanic neck or lava neck, is a volcanic object created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano.when present, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of pressure if rising volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it, and this can sometimes lead to an explosive eruption.glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, while a long slope of material remains on the opposite side.such landforms are called crag and tail.if a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains, producing a distinctive upstanding landform.

postal romanization was a system of transliterating chinese place names developed by postal authorities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.for many cities, the postal romanization was the most common english-language form of the city's name from the 1890s until the 1980s, when the pinyin system was adopted.in the late 19th century, china had various competing postal services, including a british postal service and the imperial maritime customs post office.after postmarking equipment was introduced in the 1880s, postage was cancelled with a stamp that gave the city of origin in latin letters.in 1896, the customs post was combined with other postal services and renamed the chinese imperial post.with the post office a national agency, the romanizations it used could be treated as standard.when the wade-giles system of romanization became widespread, some argued that the post office should adopt it.this idea was rejected at a conference held in 1906 in shanghai.the conference selected a system developed by herbert giles called  nanking syllabary ''.this decision allowed the post office to continue using various romanizations that it had already selected.wade-giles romanization is based on the beijing dialect, which is now standard.the system the post office adopted is based on nanjing pronunciation.

a job guarantee is an economic policy proposal aimed at providing a sustainable solution to the dual problems of inflation and unemployment.its aim is to create full employment and price stability, by having the state promise to hire unemployed workers as an employer of last resort ( elr ).the economic policy stance currently dominant around the world uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation ; when inflation rises, the government pursues contractionary fiscal or monetary policy, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, reducing wage demands, and ultimately inflation.when inflationary expectations subside, expansionary policy aims to produce the opposite effect.in marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor.by contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of  employed '' people ( employed in the job guarantee program ) provides the same protection against inflation  without '' the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.

nucleosynthesis is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from pre-existing nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) and nuclei.according to current theories, the first nuclei were formed a few minutes after the big bang, through nuclear reactions in a process called big bang nucleosynthesis.after about 20 minutes, the universe had expanded and cooled to a point at which these high-energy collisions among nucleons ended, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred, leaving our universe containing about 75 % hydrogen, 24 % helium by mass.the rest is traces of other elements such as lithium and the hydrogen isotope deuterium.nucleosynthesis in stars and their explosions later produced the variety of elements and isotopes that we have today, in a process called cosmic chemical evolution.the amounts of total mass in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ( called'metals'by astrophysicists ) remains small ( few percent ), so that the universe still has approximately the same composition.stars fuse light elements to heavier ones in their cores, giving off energy in the process known as stellar nucleosynthesis.nuclear fusion reactions create many of the lighter elements, up to and including iron and nickel in the most massive stars.products of stellar nucleosynthesis mostly remain trapped in stellar cores and remnants, except if ejected through stellar winds and explosions.the neutron capture reactions of the r-process and s-process create heavier elements, from iron upwards.supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars is largely responsible for the elements between oxygen and rubidium : from the ejection of elements produced during stellar nucleosynthesis ; through explosive nucleosynthesis during the supernova explosion ; and from the r-process ( absorption of multiple neutrons ) during the explosion.neutron star mergers are a recently discovered candidate source of elements produced in the r-process.when two neutron stars collide, a significant amount of neutron-rich matter may be ejected, including newly formed nuclei.

ngc 520 is a pair of colliding spiral galaxies about 105 million light-years away in the constellation pisces.they were discovered by astronomer william herschel on 13 december 1784.halton arp called this the second-brightest very disturbed galaxy in the sky, and it is as bright in the infrared and radio bands as the antennae galaxies.simulations indicate this object consists of two galactic disks that began interacting about 300 million years ago.the system is still in an early stage of its merger, showing two separate velocity systems in the spectra, and two small tails.the main galactic component is being viewed edge-on, making it fainter in the optical band.the secondary component is brighter but less massive than the main, and is located to the northwest.they are separated by a dark lane of dust.the region of the galaxies outside their nuclei experienced a period of increased star formation roughly around the time they began to interact.two dwarf objects are located in the vicinity of this merging pair, and one of them, designated ugc957, is located in the northern tidal tail – it may be the result of the interaction.when viewed in the x-ray band, the interacting galaxies appear around half as luminous as expected given their merger state.analysis of the gas and molecular features suggests the secondary merger component is gas poor.most of the star formation, therefore, took place in the gas-rich main component to the southeast.15 x-ray sources are detected within the merger, with many of them displaying long-term variability.a large galactic wind is evident, being driven by the starburst activity.

the battle of moscow was a military campaign that consisted of two periods of strategically significant fighting on a sector of the eastern front during world war ii.it took place between october 1941 and january 1942.the soviet defensive effort frustrated hitler's attack on moscow, the capital and largest city of the soviet union.moscow was one of the primary military and political objectives for axis forces in their invasion of the soviet union.the german strategic offensive, named operation typhoon, called for two pincer offensives, one to the north of moscow against the kalinin front by the 3rd and 4th panzer armies, simultaneously severing the moscow–leningrad railway, and another to the south of moscow oblast against the western front south of tula, by the 2nd panzer army, while the 4th army advanced directly towards moscow from the west.initially, the soviet forces conducted a strategic defence of the moscow oblast by constructing three defensive belts, deploying newly raised reserve armies, and bringing troops from the siberian and far eastern military districts.as the german offensives were halted, a soviet strategic counter-offensive and smaller-scale offensive operations forced the german armies back to the positions around the cities of oryol, vyazma and vitebsk, and nearly surrounded three german armies.it was a major setback for the germans, and the end of the idea of a quick german victory in the ussr.
bathing is the washing of the body with a liquid, usually water or an aqueous solution, or the immersion of the body in water.it may be practiced for personal hygiene, religious ritual or therapeutic purposes.by analogy, especially as a recreational activity, the term is also applied to sun bathing and sea bathing.bathing can take place in any situation where there is water, ranging from warm to cold.it can take place in a bathtub or shower, or it can be in a river, lake, water hole, pool or the sea, or any other water receptacle.the term for the act can vary.for example, a ritual religious bath is sometimes referred to as immersion or baptism, the use of water for therapeutic purposes can be called a water treatment or hydrotherapy, and two recreational water activities are known as swimming and paddling.

The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions.one of the important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.the hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system.in the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon.all vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus.in humans, it is the size of an almond.the hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system.it synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland.the hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviours, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.

fire-stick farming, also known as cultural burning and cool burning, is the practice of aboriginal australians regularly using fire to burn vegetation.aboriginal australians pre-date the extinction of the australian megafauna.the associated loss of browsing and grazing animals resulted in savannah changing into dry forest.in the resultant sclerophyll forests, fire-stick farming maintained an open canopy and allowed germination of understorey plants necessary for increasing the carrying capacity of the local environment for browsing and grazing animals.aboriginal people may have been able to aim the burning of the scrub to avoid growing areas.there may have been a ritual taboo against burning certain areas of jungle.this type of farming directly increased the food supply for aboriginal people by promoting the growth of bush potatoes and other edible ground-level plants.while it has been discontinued in many parts of australia, it has been reintroduced to some aboriginal groups by the teachings of custodians from areas where the practice is extant in continuous unbroken tradition, such as the noongar peoples'cold fire.there are a number of purposes, including to facilitate hunting, to change the composition of plant and animal species in an area, weed control, hazard reduction, and increase of biodiversity.fire-stick farming had the long-term effect of turning dry forest into savannah, increasing the population of nonspecific grass-eating species like the kangaroo.the term  fire-stick farming '' was coined by australian archaeologist rhys jones in 1969.

the law of the united states consists of many levels of codified and uncodified forms of law, of which the most important is the united states constitution, which prescribes the foundation of the federal government of the united states, as well as various civil liberties.the constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law, which consists of acts of congress, treaties ratified by the senate, regulations promulgated by the executive branch, and case law originating from the federal judiciary.the united states code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutory law.federal law and treaties, so long as they are in accordance with the constitution, preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 u.s. states and in the territories.however, the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal.in the dual-sovereign system of american federalism, states are the plenary sovereigns, each with their own constitution, while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the constitution.indeed, states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights.thus, most u.s. law ( especially the actual  living law '' of contract, tort, property, criminal, and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis ) consists primarily of state law, which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next.at both the federal and state levels, with the exception of the state of louisiana, the law of the united states is largely derived from the common law system of english law, which was in force at the time of the american revolutionary war.however, american law has diverged greatly from its english ancestor both in terms of substance and procedure and has incorporated a number of civil law innovations

in economics, a free market is a system in which the prices for goods and services are self-regulated by the open market and by consumers.in a free market, the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government or other authority, and from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies and artificial scarcities.proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a regulated market in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods such as tariffs used to restrict trade and to protect the local economy.in an idealized free-market economy, prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy.scholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a coordinated market in fields of study such as political economy, new institutional economics, economic sociology and political science.all of these fields emphasize the importance in currently existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution.although free markets are commonly associated with capitalism within a market economy in contemporary usage and popular culture, free markets have also been advocated by anarchists, socialists and some proponents of cooperatives and advocates of profit sharing.criticism of the theoretical concept may regard systems with significant market power, inequality of bargaining power, or information asymmetry as less than free, with regulation being necessary to control those imbalances in order to allow markets to function more efficiently as well as produce desirable social outcomes.

The earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 149.60 million km ( 92.96 million mi ), and one complete orbit takes days ( 1 sidereal year ), during which time earth has traveled 940 million km ( 584 million mi ).ignoring the influence of other solar system bodies, earth's orbit is an ellipse with the earth-sun barycenter as one focus and a current eccentricity of 0.0167 ; since this value is close to zero, the center of the orbit is close, relative to the size of the orbit, to the center of the sun.as seen from earth, the planet's orbital prograde motion makes the sun appear to move with respect to other stars at a rate of about 1° eastward per solar day ( or a sun or moon diameter every 12 hours ).from a vantage point above the north pole of either the sun or earth, earth would appear to revolve in a counterclockwise direction around the sun.from the same vantage point, both the earth and the sun would appear to rotate also in a counterclockwise direction about their respective axes.

A hypodermic needle is a very thin, hollow tube with a sharp tip that contains a small opening at the pointed end.it is commonly used with a syringe, a hand-operated device with a plunger, to inject substances into the body ( e.g., saline solution, solutions containing various drugs or liquid medicines ) or extract fluids from the body ( e.g., blood ).they are used to take liquid samples from the body, for example taking blood from a vein in venipuncture.large-bore hypodermic intervention is especially useful in catastrophic blood loss or treating shock.a hypodermic needle is used for rapid delivery of liquids, or when the injected substance cannot be ingested, either because it would not be absorbed ( as with insulin ), or because it would harm the liver.there are many possible routes for an injection, with the arm being a common location.the hypodermic needle also serves an important role in research environments where sterile conditions are required.the hypodermic needle significantly reduces contamination during inoculation of a sterile substrate.the hypodermic needle reduces contamination for two reasons : first, its surface is extremely smooth, which prevents airborne pathogens from becoming trapped between irregularities on the needle's surface, which would subsequently be transferred into the media ( e.g.agar ) as contaminants ; second, the needle's surface is extremely sharp, which significantly reduces the diameter of the hole remaining after puncturing the membrane and consequently prevents microbes larger than this hole from contaminating the substrate

in biology and especially genetics, a mutant is an organism or a new genetic character arising or resulting from an instance of mutation, which is generally an alteration of the dna sequence of the genome or chromosome of an organism.the term mutant is also applied to a virus with an alteration of its nucleotide sequence whose genome is rna, rather than dna.in multicellular eukaryotes, a dna sequence may be altered in an individual somatic cell that then gives rise to a mutant somatic cell lineage as happens in cancer progression.also in eukaryotes, alteration of a mitochondrial or plastid dna sequence may give rise to a mutant lineage that is inherited separately from mutant genotypes in the nuclear genome.the natural occurrence of genetic mutations is integral to the process of evolution.the study of mutants is an integral part of biology ; by understanding the effect that a mutation in a gene has, it is possible to establish the normal function of that gene

a neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes.thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence ( ai ) problems.the connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights.a positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections.all inputs are modified by a weight and summed.this activity is referred to as a linear combination.finally, an activation function controls the amplitude of the output.for example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be 1 and 1.these artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset.self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.

An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis.it provides insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated.experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results.experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom.experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time.experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons ( e.g.tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite ), to highly controlled ( e.g.tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles ).uses of experiments vary greatly between the natural and human sciences.experiments typically include controls, which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable.this increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements.scientific controls are a part of the scientific method.ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled ( accounted for by the control measurements ) and none are uncontrolled.in such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variable.

An oar is an implement used for water-borne propulsion.the difference between oars and paddles is that oars are used exclusively for rowing.in rowing the oar is connected to the vessel by means of a pivot point for the oar, either an oarlock, or a thole.the oar is placed in the pivot point with a short portion inside the vessel, and a much larger portion outside.the rower pulls on the short end of oar, while the long end is in the water.the oar is a second class lever with the water as the fulcrum, the oarlock as the load, and the rower as the force.the rower applies a large force through a small distance, which must be equaled by the small force the water applies operating over a longer distance, i.e.the work done by the rower must be balanced by the work done by the water.by contrast, paddles, are held in both hands by the paddler, and are not attached to the vessel.rowers generally face the stern of the vessel, reach towards the stern, and insert the blade of their oar in the water.as they lean back, towards the vessel's bow, the blade of their oar pivots in the oarlock, and the end in the water moves towards the stern, providing forward thrust.for thousands of years vessels were powered either by sails, or by the mechanical work of rowers, or by paddlers.some ancient vessels were propelled by both oars and sail, depending on the speed and direction of the wind

in computer central processing units, micro-operations ( also known as a micro-ops or ops, historically also as micro-actions ) are detailed low-level instructions used in some designs to implement complex machine instructions ( sometimes termed macro-instructions in this context ).usually, micro-operations perform basic operations on data stored in one or more registers, including transferring data between registers or between registers and external buses of the central processing unit ( cpu ), and performing arithmetic or logical operations on registers.in a typical fetch-decode-execute cycle, each step of a macro-instruction is decomposed during its execution so the cpu determines and steps through a series of micro-operations.the execution of micro-operations is performed under control of the cpu's control unit, which decides on their execution while performing various optimizations such as reordering, fusion and caching.

cardiac arrest is a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to pump effectively.signs include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing.some individuals may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before cardiac arrest.if not treated within minutes, it typically leads to death.the most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease.less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, heart failure, and intense physical exercise.a number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long qt syndrome.the initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation.the diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse.prevention includes not smoking, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight.treatment for cardiac arrest includes immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) and, if a shockable rhythm is present, defibrillation.among those who survive, targeted temperature management may improve outcomes.an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.in the united states, approximately 535,000 cases occur a year.about 13 per 10,000 people ( 326,000 or 61 % ) experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital setting, while 209,000 ( 39 % ) occur within a hospital.cardiac arrest becomes more common with age.it affects males more often than females.the percentage of people who survive out of hospital cardiac arrest with treatment by emergency medical services is about 8 %.many who survive have significant disability.however, many american television programs have portrayed unrealistically high survival rates of 67 %.

duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys.muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four, and worsens quickly.muscle loss typically occurs first in the thighs and pelvis followed by the arms.this can result in trouble standing up.this can result in trouble walking by the age of 12. affected muscles may look larger due to increased fat content.scoliosis is also common.some may have intellectual disability.females with a single copy of the defective gene may show mild symptoms.the disorder is x-linked recessive.about two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother, while one third of cases are due to a new mutation.it is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin.dystrophin is important to maintain the muscle fiber's cell membrane.genetic testing can often make the diagnosis at birth.those affected also have a high level of creatine kinase in their blood.although there is no known cure, physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms.assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles.medications used include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to dying muscle cells.gene therapy, as a treatment, is in the early stages of study in humans.a small initial study using gene therapy has given some children improved muscle strength, but long term effects are unknown as of 2020.dmd affects about one in 5,000 males at birth.it is the most common type of muscular dystrophy.the average life expectancy is 26 ; however, with excellent care, some may live into their 30s or 40s.

the uncanny valley is a relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object.the concept suggests that humanoid objects which imperfectly resemble actual human beings provoke uncanny or strangely familiar feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers.the valley denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.examples can be found in robotics, 3d computer animations, and lifelike dolls.with the increasing prevalence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation, the  valley '' has been cited in reaction to the verisimilitude of the creation as it approaches indistinguishability from reality.the uncanny valley hypothesis predicts that an entity appearing almost human will risk eliciting cold, eerie feelings in viewers.

ball lightning is an unexplained phenomenon described as luminescent, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter.though usually associated with thunderstorms, the phenomenon is said to last considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt.some nineteenth century reports describe balls that eventually explode and leave behind an odor of sulfur.some scientists have treated reports of ball lightning skeptically.an optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball-lightning event was published in january 2014, and included a video at high frame-rate.laboratory experiments have produced effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the supposed phenomenon remains unclear.scientists have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain reports of ball lightning over the centuries, but scientific data on ball lightning remains scarce.the presumption of its existence has depended on reported public sightings which have produced inconsistent findings.owing to inconsistencies and the lack of reliable data, the existence of ball lightning as a phenomenon remains unproven.

The taste buds contain the taste receptor cells, which are also known as gustatory cells.the taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek, and epiglottis.these structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception : salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami.a popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue ; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue.via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors.these are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds.the taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves.on average, the human tongue has 2,000–8,000 taste buds.the average lifespan of these are estimated to be 10 days.

kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp, which covers about 25 % of the world's coastlines.they are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on earth.smaller areas of anchored kelp are called kelp beds.kelp forests occur worldwide throughout temperate and polar coastal oceans.in 2007, kelp forests were also discovered in tropical waters near ecuador.physically formed by brown macroalgae, kelp forests provide a unique habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes.over the last century, they have been the focus of extensive research, particularly in trophic ecology, and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem.however, the influence of humans has often contributed to kelp forest degradation.of particular concern are the effects of overfishing nearshore ecosystems, which can release herbivores from their normal population regulation and result in the overgrazing of kelp and other algae.this can rapidly result in transitions to barren landscapes where relatively few species persist.the implementation of marine protected areas is one management strategy useful for addressing such issues, since it may limit the impacts of fishing and buffer the ecosystem from additive effects of other environmental stressors

Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of accounting in business.transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation.there are several standard methods of bookkeeping, including the single-entry and double-entry bookkeeping systems.while these may be viewed as  real '' bookkeeping, any process for recording financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.bookkeeping is the work of a bookkeeper ( or book-keeper ), who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business.they usually write the  daybooks '' ( which contain records of sales, purchases, receipts, and payments ), and document each financial transaction, whether cash or credit, into the correct daybook—that is, petty cash book, suppliers ledger, customer ledger, etc.—and the general ledger.thereafter, an accountant can create financial reports from the information recorded by the bookkeeper.bookkeeping refers mainly to the record-keeping aspects of financial accounting, and involves preparing source documents for all transactions, operations, and other events of a business.the bookkeeper brings the books to the trial balance stage : an accountant may prepare the income statement and balance sheet using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.

racewalking, or race walking, is a long-distance discipline within the sport of athletics.although it is a foot race, it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times.this is assessed by race judges.typically held on either roads or on running tracks, common distances range from up to 100 kilometres ( 62.1 mi ).there are two racewalking distances contested at the summer olympics : the 20 kilometres race walk ( men and women ) and the 50 kilometres race walk ( men only ).both are held as road events.the iaaf world race walking cup, first held in 1961, is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has 10 kilometres race walks for junior athletes, in addition to the olympic-standard events.the sport emerged from a british culture of long-distance competitive walking known as pedestrianism, which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century.since the mid-20th century onwards, russian and chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage, with europe and parts of latin america producing most of the remaining top level walkers.

in mathematics, the laplace operator or laplacian is a differential operator given by the divergence of the gradient of a function on euclidean space.it is named after the french mathematician pierre-simon de laplace ( 1749–1827 ), who first applied the operator to the study of celestial mechanics, where the operator gives a constant multiple of the mass density when it is applied to the gravitational potential due to the mass distribution with that given density.solutions of the equation, now called laplace's equation, are the so-called harmonic functions and represent the possible gravitational fields in regions of vacuum.the laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical phenomena, such as electric and gravitational potentials, the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics.the laplacian represents the flux density of the gradient flow of a function.for these reasons, it is extensively used in the sciences for modelling all kinds of physical phenomena.

a mesh network is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes ( i.e.bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices ) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients.this lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information.mesh networks dynamically self-organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead.the ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event a few nodes fail.this in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs.

in physics, a shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance that moves faster than the local speed of sound in the medium.like an ordinary wave, a shock wave carries energy and can propagate through a medium but is characterized by an abrupt, nearly discontinuous, change in pressure, temperature, and density of the medium.for the purpose of comparison, in supersonic flows, additional increased expansion may be achieved through an expansion fan, also known as a prandtl–meyer expansion fan.the accompanying expansion wave may approach and eventually collide and recombine with the shock wave, creating a process of destructive interference.the sonic boom associated with the passage of a supersonic aircraft is a type of sound wave produced by constructive interference.unlike solitons ( another kind of nonlinear wave ), the energy and speed of a shock wave alone dissipates relatively quickly with distance.when a shock wave passes through matter, energy is preserved but entropy increases.this change in the matter's properties manifests itself as a decrease in the energy which can be extracted as work, and as a drag force on supersonic objects ; shock waves are strongly irreversible processes.

dynamic programming is a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method developed by richard bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.in both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner.while some decision problems can not be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively.likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.if sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.in the optimization literature this relationship is called the bellman equation.

benthos is the community of organisms that live on, in, or near the seabed, river, lake, or stream bottom, also known as the benthic zone.this community lives in or near marine or freshwater sedimentary environments, from tidal pools along the foreshore, out to the continental shelf, and then down to the abyssal depths.many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure can not survive in the upperparts of the water column.the pressure difference can be very significant ( approximately one atmosphere for each 10 metres of water depth ).because light is absorbed before it reaches deep ocean-water, the energy source for deep benthic ecosystems is often organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths.this dead and decaying matter sustains the benthic food chain ; most organisms in the benthic zone are scavengers or detritivores.the term  benthos '', coined by haeckel in 1891, comes from the greek noun  depth of the sea ''.

in mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities.if not continuous, a function is said to be  discontinuous ''.up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, during which attempts such as the epsilon–delta definition were made to formalize it.continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of topology, which is treated in full generality below.the introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are real numbers.the stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity.in addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two metric spaces.in order theory, especially in domain theory, one considers a notion of continuity known as scott continuity.other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article.

the aldol reaction is a means of forming carbon–carbon bonds in organic chemistry.discovered independently by the russian chemist alexander borodin in 1869 and by the french chemist charles-adolphe wurtz in 1872, the reaction combines two carbonyl compounds ( the original experiments used aldehydes ) to form a new -hydroxy carbonyl compound.these products are known as  aldols '', from the  ald '' ehyde + alcoh '' ol '', a structural motif seen in many of the products.the aldol reaction unites two relatively simple molecules into a more complex one.increased complexity arises because up to two new stereogenic centers ( on the - and -carbon of the aldol adduct, marked with asterisks ) are formed.modern methodology is capable of not only allowing aldol reactions to proceed in high yield but also controlling both the relative and absolute configuration of these stereocenters.this ability to selectively synthesize a particular stereoisomer is significant because different stereoisomers can have very different chemical and biological properties.for example, stereogenic aldol units are especially common in polyketides, a class of molecules found in biological organisms.in nature, polyketides are synthesized by enzymes that effect iterative claisen condensations.the 1,3-dicarbonyl products of these reactions can then be variously derivatized to produce a wide variety of interesting structures.often, such derivatization involves the reduction of one of the carbonyl groups, producing the aldol subunit.some of these structures have potent biological properties

endocrine glands are ductless glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products directly into the blood.the major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands.the hypothalamus and pituitary glands are neuroendocrine organs.the pituitary gland hangs from the base of the brain by the pituitary stalk, and is enclosed by bone.it consists of a hormone-producing glandular portion of the anterior pituitary and a neural portion of the posterior pituitary, which is an extension of the hypothalamus.the hypothalamus regulates the hormonal output of the anterior pituitary and creates two hormones that it exports to the posterior pituitary for storage and later release.four of the six anterior pituitary hormones are tropic hormones that regulate the function of other endocrine organs.most anterior pituitary hormones exhibit a diurnal rhythm of release, which is subject to modification by stimuli influencing the hypothalamus.somatotropic hormone or growth hormone ( gh ) is an anabolic hormone that stimulates the growth of all body tissues especially skeletal muscle and bone.it may act directly, or indirectly via insulin-like growth factors ( igfs ).gh mobilizes fats, stimulates protein synthesis, and inhibits glucose uptake and metabolism.secretion is regulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh ) and growth hormone inhibiting hormone ( ghih ), or somatostatin.hypersecretion causes gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults ; hyposecretion in children causes pituitary dwarfism

metamorphic rocks are formed from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means  change in form ''.the original rock ( protolith ) is subjected to heat ( temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °c ) and pressure ( or more ), causing profound physical or chemical change.the protolith may be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock.metamorphic rocks make up a large part of the earth's crust and form 12 % of the earth's land surface.they are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage ( metamorphic facies ).they may be formed simply by being deep beneath the earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it.they can form from tectonic processes such as continental collisions, which cause horizontal pressure, friction and distortion.they can form when rock is heated by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the earth's interior.the study of metamorphic rocks ( now exposed at the earth's surface following erosion and uplift ) provides information about the temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the earth's crust.some examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss, slate, marble, schist, and quartzite.

desktop publishing ( dtp ) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal (  desktop '' ) computer.it was first used almost exclusively for print publications, but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content.desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing.this technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content, from menus to magazines to books, without the expense of commercial printing.desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and wysiwyg page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution – although a non-wysiwyg system such as latex could also be used for the creation of highly structured and technically demanding documents as well.desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than word processing.

old frisian is a west germanic language spoken between the 8th and 16th centuries in the area between the rhine and weser on the european north sea coast.the frisian settlers on the coast of south jutland ( today's northern friesland ) also spoke old frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known.the language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the zuiderzee and ems river ( the frisians mentioned by tacitus ) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names.in the early middle ages, frisia stretched from the area around bruges, in what is now belgium, to the weser river in northern germany.at the time, the frisian language was spoken along the entire southern north sea coast.this region is referred to as greater frisia or frisia magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their frisian heritage.by 1300, their territory had been pushed back to the zuiderzee ( now the ijsselmeer ), and the frisian language survives along the coast only as a substrate.a close relationship exists between old frisian and old english ; this is due to a shared history, language and culture of the people from northern germany and denmark who came to settle in england from around 400ad onwards.

in mathematics, the mediant of two fractions, generally made up of four positive integersthat is to say, the numerator and denominator of the mediant are the sums of the numerators and denominators of the given fractions, respectively.it is sometimes called the freshman sum, as it is a common mistake in the early stages of learning about addition of fractions.technically, this is a binary operation on valid fractions ( nonzero denominator ), considered as ordered pairs of appropriate integers, a priori disregarding the perspective on rational numbers as equivalence classes of fractions.for a stronger connection to rational numbers the fractions may be required to be reduced to lowest terms, thereby selecting unique representatives from the respective equivalence classes.the stern-brocot tree provides an enumeration of all positive rational numbers via mediants in lowest terms, obtained purely by iterative computation of the mediant according to a simple algorithm.
