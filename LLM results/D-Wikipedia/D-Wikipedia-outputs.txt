Square root methods are algorithms used to find the non-negative square root of a real number. This can be done arithmetically, algebraically, or geometrically. Every real number has two square roots, with the principal square root usually being an irrational number. Even if the square root is a perfect square integer, the procedure used to compute it may only return increasingly accurate approximations. The continued fraction representation of a real number can be used instead of its decimal or binary expansion. The most common analytical methods are iterative and consist of finding a suitable starting value and iteratively refining it until some termination criteria is met. Newton's method is the most familiar method. Some methods do not require a starting value. The method used depends on the desired accuracy, effort, and tools available. Procedures for finding square roots have been known since ancient Babylon, and modern analytic methods began to be developed after the introduction of the Arabic numeral system to Western Europe. Today, nearly all computing devices have a fast and accurate square root function.

The parallel postulate is an important rule in geometry. It says that if a line crosses two other lines and the angles on one side add up to less than two right angles, then the two lines will meet on that side if they are extended. This rule is not specifically about parallel lines, but it is related to them. Euclid, who wrote a book about geometry called "Elements," defined parallel lines in his book. Euclidean geometry is the study of geometry that follows all of Euclid's rules, including the parallel postulate. However, it was later discovered that there are other valid geometries that do not follow the parallel postulate, known as non-Euclidean geometries. Geometry that only follows the first four postulates is called absolute or neutral geometry.

John Tyler was the tenth president of the United States from 1841 to 1845. He became president after William Henry Harrison died in 1841, only a month after taking office. Tyler was a supporter of states' rights and only adopted nationalistic policies when they did not infringe on the powers of the states. He was initially a Democrat but opposed Andrew Jackson during the nullification crisis and criticized Jackson's expansion of executive power during the bank war. This led Tyler to ally with the Whig party. Tyler signed into law some of the Whig-controlled Congress's bills but vetoed the party's bills to create a national bank and raise the tariff rates. Tyler was the first vice president to succeed to the presidency without election. He faced a stalemate on domestic policy, although he had several foreign-policy achievements. Tyler worked diligently to annex Texas and signed a bill to annex Texas three days before leaving office. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Tyler sided with the Confederacy and won election to the Confederate House of Representatives shortly before his death.

He was in various bands before joining the U.S. Navy to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, he deserted to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band The Mynah Birds. They signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966, but James' career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and convicted him of desertion. After being released from prison, James moved to California and started a variety of rock and funk groups. He finally found success as a recording artist in 1978 after signing with Motown's Gordy Records and releasing the album "Come Get It!" In 1981, he released his most successful album, "Street Songs," which included hits such as "Give It to Me Baby" and "Super Freak." James was also known for his soulful ballads. He had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists, including Teena Marie, The Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Eddie Murphy, and Smokey Robinson. James' mainstream success peaked with the release of his album "Glow" in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show "The A-Team."

Jan Hus was a Czech theologian and philosopher who became a church reformer and an inspirer of Hussitism, a key predecessor to Protestantism and a seminal figure in the Bohemian Reformation. He was born in Husinec, Bohemia to poor parents and trained for the priesthood to escape poverty. After earning a bachelor of arts degree and being ordained as a priest, Hus began to preach in Prague. He opposed many aspects of the Catholic Church in Bohemia and was excommunicated by the Pope. Hus was eventually taken in front of the Council of Constance and asked to recant his views, but he refused and was burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of the Catholic Church. After his execution, his followers (known as Hussites) refused to elect another Catholic monarch and defeated five consecutive papal crusades between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the Hussite Wars. The Bohemian and Moravian populations remained majority Hussite until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the Battle of the White Mountain resulted in the lands of the Bohemian Crown coming under Habsburg dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion in an intense campaign of return to Catholicism.

A digital signal is a way of representing data using discrete values, unlike analog signals which use continuous values. Simple digital signals use bands of analog levels to represent information. In most cases, digital signals have two possible values, represented by voltage bands near a reference value and the supply voltage. This corresponds to the boolean domain of "false" and "true" or "zero" and "one". Digital signals are immune to electronic noise, making them more reliable than analog signals. Digital signals can have more than two states, which is called multivalued logic. Digital signals can be represented by various physical quantities such as electric current or voltage, electromagnetic fields, acoustic pressure, or magnetic storage media. Digital signals are used in computing and data transmission.

In France and some other French-speaking countries, the gendarmerie is part of the armed forces and is responsible for security in rural areas and small towns. Other countries have adopted the concept, including former French colonies. The growth of gendarmerie units is due to governments being hesitant to use military units for internal threats. Some countries have formed paramilitary units under civilian police agencies, but these are not considered gendarmerie. Examples of modern gendarmerie organizations include the French national gendarmerie, Spanish civil guard, Argentine national gendarmerie, Italian carabinieri, Dutch marechaussee, Portuguese national republican guard, and Turkish gendarmerie.

Lactation is when a mother produces milk to feed her young. This happens naturally in all female mammals after pregnancy. In humans, it's called breastfeeding or nursing. Sometimes newborns can produce milk from their own breast tissue, which is called witch's milk. Most mammals release milk from their nipples, but egg-laying mammals release milk through ducts in their abdomen. Only the dayak fruit bat from southeast Asia has milk production as a normal male function. Galactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production, which requires prolactin. Oxytocin is important for the milk let-down reflex when the baby is suckling. Galactorrhea is when milk is produced unrelated to nursing and can happen in males and females due to hormonal imbalances.

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) is when people claim to be sensitive to electromagnetic fields and experience negative symptoms. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim and it is not a recognized medical diagnosis. People with EHS report symptoms that are not specific and can be attributed to other causes. They also report adverse reactions to electromagnetic fields at levels well below the maximum permitted by international radiation safety standards. Studies have shown that people with EHS are unable to distinguish between exposure and non-exposure to electromagnetic fields. A review of medical research in 2011 found no convincing evidence that electromagnetic fields cause symptoms. Recent double-blind experiments have shown that people with EHS are unable to detect the presence of electromagnetic fields and are as likely to report ill health following a sham exposure as they are following exposure to genuine electromagnetic fields. This suggests that the cause of their symptoms may be the nocebo effect. Some people with EHS may try to reduce their exposure or use alternative medicine. However, government agencies have enforced false advertising claims against companies selling devices to shield against electromagnetic radiation.

Trento Longaretti was an Italian painter who studied at the Brera Academy in the 1930s. He was taught by famous artists such as Aldo Carpi, Pompeo Borra, Francesco Messina, and Marino Marini. Longaretti believed that painting was an "elixir for long life" and continued to paint and exhibit even as a centenarian. He was on the fringes of the "Corrente" movement, which opposed the Italian Fascist movement. Longaretti was drafted into the Italian army in 1939, which interrupted his artwork until 1945. His post-war works involved more sacred art, and he adopted an anti-war stance and opposition to violence. Longaretti's paintings often depicted themes such as loneliness, abandonment, exile, pilgrimage, and poverty. He preferred creating works that were "accessible and immediately enjoyable." Longaretti's oil paintings were dense and oily, similar to those of Paul Cézanne, and his style had similarities to the fantasy settings of Marc Chagall and the "pictorial culture" of Egon Schiele. He became involved in the Italian figurative art movement of the mid-1900s and exhibited at prestigious events such as the Venice Biennale and Rome Quadriennale. Longaretti earned the "chair of painting" and became the director of the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo in 1953, a position he held until he retired in 1978. He maintained studios in the Città Alta of Bergamo and in Corniglia within the Cinque Terre, which he described as one of the most beautiful places in the world.

Surfing is when a person rides on the front of a moving wave, usually in the ocean, using a board. There are different types of boards and ways to ride the wave, including body boarding, knee boarding, and stand-up surfing. Some surfers use artificial waves or ride waves created by boats. Stand-up surfing has three main types: stand-up paddling, long boarding, and short boarding. Tow-in surfing uses a motorized vehicle to help the surfer match the speed of a large wave.

VHF Omni-Directional Range (VOR) is a radio navigation system for aircraft that helps determine position and stay on course. It uses radio signals from fixed ground beacons in the VHF frequency band. VOR was developed in the US in 1937 and is now the standard air navigational system used worldwide. There were about 3,000 VOR stations operating globally in 2000, but this number has decreased due to the widespread adoption of GPS. A VOR ground station sends a highly directional signal that rotates 30 times a second. It also sends a reference signal on a subcarrier that is the same in all directions. The phase difference between the reference signal and the signal amplitude is the bearing from the VOR station to the receiver relative to magnetic north. This line of position is called the VOR "radial". VOR stations are short-range and useful for up to 200 miles. Each station broadcasts a composite signal including the navigation signal, station identifier, and voice if equipped. The navigation signal allows the receiving equipment to determine the direction from the VOR station in relation to magnetic north. The station identifier is typically a three-letter string in Morse code, and the voice signal is usually the station name, in-flight recorded advisories, or live flight service broadcasts.

Scientific notation is a way to write really big or really small numbers using powers of ten. It's also called scientific form or standard index form. Scientists, mathematicians, and engineers use it because it makes some math easier. On calculators, it's called "sci" mode. In scientific notation, all numbers are written as "m" times ten to the power of "n," where "m" can be any real number and "n" is an integer. "N" is called the order of magnitude and "m" is called the significand or mantissa. If "m" is negative, there's a minus sign in front of it. In normalized notation, the exponent is chosen so that the absolute value of "m" is at least 1 but less than 10. Decimal floating point is a computer system that's like scientific notation.

The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a Dutch horror film from 2009. It was written, directed, and co-produced by Tom Six. The movie is about a crazy German surgeon who kidnaps three tourists and surgically joins them together, mouth to anus, to create a "human centipede." The main character, Josef Heiter, is played by Dieter Laser, and his victims are played by Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie, and Akihiro Kitamura.

The movie was inspired by Nazi medical experiments from World War II, such as the crimes of Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Six didn't tell investors about the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot because he was afraid it would scare them away. The movie got mixed reviews from critics, but it won awards at international film festivals. It was released in the United States on April 30, 2010. Two sequels were made, called "Full Sequence" and "Final Sequence," both written and directed by Six. The trilogy was combined into one movie in 2016, called "Complete Sequence."

Swisscom AG is a telecommunications provider in Switzerland. The Swiss government owns 51% of the company. Swisscom has a 60% market share for mobile, 67% for broadband, and 33% for TV telecommunications in Switzerland. Its Italian subsidiary, Fastweb, has a 16% share of private clients and 29% share of corporate clients in the Italian broadband market and is also active in the mobile market. The Swiss telegraph network was established in 1852, followed by telephones in 1877. The networks were combined with the postal service in 1920 to form the PTT. Swisscom struggled to develop a homegrown digital network, but pioneered the Natel mobile service in 1978 and the GSM-based Natel D in 1993. The Swiss telecommunications market was deregulated in 1997, and Telecom PTT was spun off and rebranded Swisscom. In 2001, 25% of Swisscom Mobile was sold to Vodafone. Swisscom has since bought a majority stake in Italy's second-biggest telecom company, Fastweb, and invested in areas such as hospitality support, cloud services, and billing. New services in the areas of digitization and IT services are intended to compensate for the risk of revenue losses from the traditional core business.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a condition where the immune system damages the peripheral nervous system, causing rapid muscle weakness. Symptoms usually start with changes in sensation or pain in the back, followed by weakness in the feet and hands that spreads to the arms and upper body. This can be life-threatening, with breathing muscles weakening in about 15% of cases. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by infection, surgery, or vaccination. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and tests. Treatment involves intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, with recovery taking weeks to years. Death occurs in about 7.5% of cases. GBS is rare, affecting one or two people per 100,000 each year. It was named after French neurologists Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, who described it in 1916.

This development also led to other important evolutionary changes, like the body plan and the specialization of body segments.

The Jurassic period lasted 56 million years and was part of the Mesozoic era, also known as the age of reptiles. It was marked by three extinction events, but none were as significant as the "big five" mass extinctions. The period is divided into three epochs and three series of rock formations. It is named after the Jura Mountains in the European Alps. During the Jurassic period, the supercontinent Pangaea began to split into two landmasses, creating more coastlines and shifting the climate from dry to humid. The fauna transitioned from a mix of dinosauromorph and crocodylomorph archosaurs to one dominated by dinosaurs. Birds evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs, and other significant events included the appearance of the earliest lizards and the evolution of therian mammals. Marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs inhabited the oceans, while pterosaurs were the dominant flying vertebrates.
